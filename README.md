# Interactive Density Map

MoveApps

Github repository: *github.com/mscacco/interactiveDensityMap*

## Description
Density raster containing the number of instances of the specified variable overlaid on an interactive map. The user can choose between displaying the number of GPS locations per pixel, the number of individuals, the number of species or the number of Movebank studies. The variable is rasterized on a grid of user-defined resolution (pixel size) and overlaid on a interactive map. The map can be zoomed, the color palette reversed, and the background openstreetmap can be selected as `TopoMap`or `Aerial`. The map interactively updates when the user selects a different variable to display or a different pixel size.

*Suggestion: if the chosen dataset covers a large area and at first you do not see the raster on the map, try increasing the pixel size.*

## Documentation
This App creates a Shiny UI that allows the interactive visualization of the number of GPS locations, number of individuals and species in different regions of the map. This App extracts from the MoveStack the variable `var` selected by the user (by default the number of GPS locations) and counts the number of instances falling in each raster cell. For further analyses the input data set is also returned.

### Input data
MoveStack in Movebank format.

### Output data
Shiny user interface (UI) and MoveStack in Movebank format.

### Artefacts
None.

`DensityMap.png`: The visualization produced by the App can be saved (via "Save Plot") in *.png* format to the "Output" folder in Moveapps.

### Parameters 
`variable`: variable that the user wants to be rasterized as number of occurrences per raster cell. The user can choose one of `n_locations` (default), `n_individuals`, `n_species` or `n_studies`.

`reverse palette`: this will allow you to reverse the order of the colors in the palette. For better visualization, we suggest to tick the "reverse color palette" box in combination with an `Aerial` map (the opposite when using a `TopoMap`).

`pixel size`: desired resolution (pixel size) of the grid used to rasterize the chosen variable. Unit is degree, with a possible range of *0.01* to *5* degrees (corresponding to about 1 to 500 km). Default value is *0.05*.

### Null or error handling
If one of the user parameters are not defined, the App will use the default values (`var` = `n_locations` and `pxSize` = *0.05*)
